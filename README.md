# Fitgram
## Code by Samantha and Lily
## Designed by UI Design Group 19 (Hannah, Neha, Samantha, and Lily)

This is a react native project supporting iOS and Android on Expo. Fitgram allows users to upload their outfits each day and see what their friends are wearing. It provides a fun, supportive fashion community!

This project uses local data for the images, and does not yet support picture taking or posting. It is mostly a frontend implementation of all of the screens present in our Figma.
